# Prefix Max

## Problem
You are given an array of n
 integers a1,a2,…,an
.

The value of an array is the sum of the maximums of each prefix of the array. More formally, the value of an array a
 is ∑ni=1max(a1,…,ai)
. For example, the value of the array [1,2,1
] is max(1)+max(1,2)+max(1,2,1)=1+2+2=5
.

You can choose two indices i
 and j
 and swap elements ai
 and aj
; this operation can be applied at most one time.

Find the maximum possible value of the array a
 after at most one operation.

## Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer t
 (1≤t≤100
) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n
 (2≤n≤50
) — the length of the array a
.

The second line contains n
 integers a1,a2,…,an
 (1≤ai≤104
) — the array a
.

## Output

For each test case, output the maximum possible value of the array a
 after the swap has been performed.
